 * Update Model to Use Before Model Call
 *
 * This capability enables dynamic model selection based on context, allowing the agent to choose the most
 * appropriate language model for each specific task or situation.
 *
 * Why this is important:
 * - Cost Optimization: Uses smaller, cheaper models for simple tasks and reserves powerful models for complex reasoning
 * - Performance Matching: Selects models with capabilities that match the specific requirements of each request
 * - Specialized Routing: Directs different types of queries to models that excel in those particular domains
 *
 * Example Scenario:
 * You're building a coding assistant that handles both simple syntax questions and complex algorithm design.
 * Simple questions like "How do I declare a variable?" use a fast, cost-effective model, while complex requests
 * like "Design a distributed caching algorithm" are routed to a more powerful model.

 * üî§ Simple Syntax Question
 *
 * üß† Model Selection Analysis:
 *   Query: "How do I declare a variable in JavaScript?..."
 *   Complexity: simple
 *   Domain: syntax
 *   Selected Model: gpt-4o-mini
 * 
 * Response: In JavaScript, you can declare a variable using one of three keywords: `var`, `let`, or `const`.
 * Here's how to use each one:
 *
 * 1. **Using `var`:** This keyword declares a variable that can be re-assigned and has function scope or global scope.
 *    ```javascript
 *    var name = "Alice";
 *    ```
 *
 * 2. **Using `let`:** This keyword declares a block-scoped variable that can be re-assigned.
 *    ```javascript
 *    let age = 25;
 *    ```
 *
 * 3. **Using `const`:** This keyword declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be re-assigned (though the value itself may be mutable if it's an object or array).
 *    ```javascript
 *    const pi = 3.14;
 *    ```
 *
 * Choose `let` for variables that you expect to change, and `const` for constants that should not change. Use `var` if you need to support older JavaScript environments, but it's generally recommended to use `let` and `const` in modern code.
 *
 * üîç Code Debugging Question
 *
 * üß† Model Selection Analysis:
 *   Query: "I need help debugging this function. What are the best pract..."
 *   Complexity: moderate
 *   Domain: general
 *   Selected Model: gpt-4o-moderate
 *
 * Response: To help you debug and improve this function, let's go through some best practices and potential improvements:
 *
 * 1. **Understand the Functionality**:
 *    The function `findDuplicates` is designed to return an array of duplicate elements from the input array `arr`.
 *
 * 2. **Check for Edge Cases**:
 *    Consider what happens if the input array is empty or contains only one element. The function should handle these cases gracefully.
 *
 * 3. **Optimize for Efficiency**:
 *    The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops and the `includes` method inside the loop. This can be improved using a more efficient approach.
 *
 * 4. **Use a Set for Tracking**:
 *    Instead of checking if an element is already in the `duplicates` array using `includes`, which is O(n), you can use a `Set` to track seen elements and duplicates, which provides O(1) average time complexity for lookups.
 *
 * 5. **Code Readability and Comments**:
 *    Ensure the code is easy to read and understand. Adding comments can help explain the logic.
 *
 * Here is a revised version of the function with these best practices in mind:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * function findDuplicates(arr) {
 *   const seen = new Set();
 *   const duplicates = new Set();
 *
 *   for (const element of arr) {
 *     if (seen.has(element)) {
 *       duplicates.add(element);
 *     } else {
 *       seen.add(element);
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   // Convert the Set of duplicates to an array before returning
 *   return Array.from(duplicates);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Explanation:
 *
 * - **Sets for Efficiency**: We use two sets: `seen` to track all elements we have encountered and `duplicates` to store elements that appear more than once.
 * - **Single Loop**: The function now uses a single loop, reducing the time complexity to O(n).
 * - **Conversion to Array**: Finally, we convert the `duplicates` set to an array before returning it, as the function is expected to return an array.
 *
 * By following these practices, the function becomes more efficient and easier to maintain.
 *
 * üß† Complex Algorithm Design
 *
 * üß† Model Selection Analysis:
 *   Query: "Design a distributed caching algorithm that can handle high ..."
 *   Complexity: complex
 *   Domain: algorithm
 *   Selected Model: gpt-4o
 * 
 * Response: To design a distributed caching algorithm that handles high concurrency, provides consistent data
 * across multiple nodes, and includes automatic failover capabilities, we need to consider several key components
 * and strategies. Here's a high-level design using the CAP theorem principles, focusing on Consistency and
 * Availability while ensuring Partition Tolerance:
 *
 * ### 1. Architecture Overview
 *
 * - **Nodes**: Multiple cache nodes distributed across different servers or data centers.
 * - **Data Partitioning**: Use consistent hashing to distribute data evenly across nodes, minimizing data movement when nodes are added or removed.
 * - **Replication**: Implement data replication to ensure availability and fault tolerance.
 *
 * ### 2. Consistency Model
 *
 * - **Strong Consistency**: Use a consensus protocol like Paxos or Raft to ensure that all nodes agree on the data state before any read or write operation is considered complete.
 * - **Read Repair**: Implement read repair mechanisms to correct any inconsistencies detected during read operations.
 *
 * ### 3. Concurrency Control
 *
 * - **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: Allow multiple transactions to proceed without locking resources, checking for conflicts at commit time.
 * - **Versioning**: Use version numbers or timestamps to manage concurrent updates and resolve conflicts.
 *
 * ### 4. Automatic Failover
 *
 * - **Leader Election**: Use a leader election algorithm (e.g., Raft) to manage node failures and elect a new leader when necessary.
 * - **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Nodes send regular heartbeat messages to detect failures quickly.
- **Data Replication**: Maintain multiple replicas of each data item across different nodes to ensure data availability even if some nodes fail.
 *
 * ### 5. High Concurrency Handling
 *
 * - **Sharding**: Distribute data across multiple shards to balance load and reduce contention.
 * - **Load Balancing**: Use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests evenly across nodes.
 * - **Asynchronous Writes**: Allow asynchronous writes to improve write throughput, with mechanisms to ensure eventual consistency.
 *
 * ### 6. Implementation Considerations
 *
 * - **Data Serialization**: Use efficient serialization formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers) to minimize network overhead.
 * - **Network Protocol**: Use a lightweight protocol like gRPC for communication between nodes.
 * - **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track system performance and diagnose issues.
 *
 * ### 7. Example Technologies
 *
 * - **Distributed Consensus**: Apache Zookeeper, etcd
 * - **Distributed Cache**: Redis Cluster, Memcached with consistent hashing
 * - **Load Balancing**: NGINX, HAProxy
 *
 * ### 8. Challenges and Trade-offs
 *
 * - **Latency vs. Consistency**: Balancing the trade-off between low latency and strong consistency.
 * - **Network Partitions**: Designing the system to handle network partitions gracefully without compromising availability.
 *
 * This design provides a robust framework for a distributed caching system capable of handling high concurrency with consistent data across nodes and automatic failover capabilities. Implementing such a system requires careful consideration of the specific use case and workload characteristics to optimize performance and reliability.
